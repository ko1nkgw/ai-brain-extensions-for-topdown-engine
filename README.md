# AI Brain Graph for TopDown Engine

This is an extension for the Unity3D [Top Down Engine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/topdown-engine-89636?aid=1011lHJn). It uses [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) to create AI Brain graphs that can generate regular TopDown Engine AI systems.

For a tour of the [TopDown Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLiyTSvY9s0&feature=emb_logo) features, please check this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bAt1i9gfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bAt1i9gfo).
